AI: The disease detected is blight. This means the crop is facing potential damage, which can reduce yields.

Here are some steps you can take now:

1. Remove any affected leaves or plant parts carefully to prevent further spread.
2. Treat the remaining healthy parts with a copper-based fungicide as soon as you notice early signs.
3. Avoid overhead watering to keep the leaves dry and reduce humidity around the plants.
4. Ensure good air circulation by spacing your plants properly and pruning where necessary.
5. Clean your tools and equipment after working on affected plants to avoid spreading the disease.

For prevention, keep an eye on your plants for any early signs of blight so you can act quickly. 

As a low-cost option, you can use homemade fungicides made from baking soda and water as a preventive measure.
